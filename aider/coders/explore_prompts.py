## Available tools

### list-files
```
usage: list-files.py [-h] [--files-only] [--dirs-only] [--name NAME] [--ext EXT]
                     [--recursive] [--no-recursive] [--max-depth MAX_DEPTH]
                     [--max-tokens MAX_TOKENS]
                     [directory]

positional arguments:
  directory             Directory to list (default: current directory)

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --files-only          List only files (exclude directories)
  --dirs-only           List only directories (exclude files)
  --name NAME           Filter by name (case-insensitive, supports partial matches)
  --ext EXT             Filter by file extension (e.g. 'py' or 'txt')
  --recursive           Enable recursive directory traversal (default: True)
  --no-recursive        Disable recursive directory traversal
  --max-depth MAX_DEPTH Maximum recursion depth (default: unlimited)
  --max-tokens MAX_TOKENS
                        Maximum output size in tokens (default: 10000 ~40KB)
```

### search-files
```
usage: search-files.py [-h] [--files-only] [--max-tokens MAX_TOKENS] [--max-results MAX_RESULTS]
                       [--ext EXT] [--fixed-strings] [--files] [--glob GLOB]
                       search_term [directory]

positional arguments:
  search_term           Search term (regex pattern)
  directory             Directory to search (default: current directory)

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --files-only          Only show files containing matches, not the matches themselves
  --max-tokens MAX_TOKENS
                        Maximum output size in tokens (default: 10000 ~40KB)
  --max-results MAX_RESULTS
                        Maximum number of matches to return per file (uses rg --max-count)
  --ext EXT             Filter by file extensions (comma-separated, e.g. 'py,txt')
  --fixed-strings       Treat search term as literal string instead of regex
  --files               List files instead of searching content
  --glob GLOB           File pattern to include/exclude (can be used multiple times)
```

## Tool usage examples

1. Default recursive file listing:
```cmd
list-files C:\\projects\\myapp
```

2. Non-recursive directory listing:
```cmd
list-files . --no-recursive --dirs-only
```

3. After identifying the extensions that exist (using `list-files`),
   list only those. For example, in a C/C++ repository:
```cmd
list-files src --ext c,cpp,h,hpp --files-only
```

4. Find config files up to 2 levels deep:
```cmd
list-files . --name config --max-depth 2
```

5. Search for function/method definitions (adapt to language):
```cmd
search-files "function|def|class|interface|struct|void|public" src
```

6. Literal string search for exact match:
```cmd
search-files --fixed-strings "exact.phrase()"
```

7. File listing with multiple patterns:
```cmd
search-files --files --glob "*.cpp" --glob "!*Test.cpp" src
```

8. Content search with extension filter:
```cmd
search-files --ext py,js --fixed-strings "TODO: " src
```

9. Find all test files containing assertions:
```cmd
search-files --glob "*test*" --fixed-strings "assert("
```

10. Case-insensitive class search:
```cmd
search-files -i "class\\s+game_" src
```

11. Find non-test source files:
```cmd
search-files --files --glob "*.cpp" --glob "!*Test*"
```

12. Search for hex values in code:
```cmd
search-files "0x[0-9a-fA-F]{{4,}}" src
```

*Concisely* suggest any shell commands the user might want to run in ```cmd blocks.

Just suggest shell commands this way, not example code.
Only suggest complete shell commands that are ready to execute, without placeholders.
Only suggest at most a few shell commands at a time, not more than 1-3, one per line.
Do not suggest multi-line shell commands.
All shell commands will run from the root directory of the user's project.

Use the appropriate shell based on the user's system info:
{platform}
Examples of when to suggest shell commands:

- If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
- If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
- If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
- Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
- If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
- Etc.
